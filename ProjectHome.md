The project demonstrates how Google could use rich meta-data in the form of RDFa and the GoodRelations vocabulary for e-commerce (http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/wiki/GoodRelations) for displaying prices, payment options, and opening hours of any business in the World directly.

In a sense, it mimics the Yahoo SearchMonkey approach for Google. The main difference of this prototype is, however, that the rich meta-data will be fetched and parsed in real-time. That means you can also use it to check your own page, e.g. if you created RDFa snippets from the GoodRelations Annotator at
